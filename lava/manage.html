                Our tailored cloud service solutions are designed to effectively aid in increasing the agility of your business by analyzing the technologies you are using and determining which ones could be migrated to the cloud to increase functionality and decrease costs.

            <h2>Disaster Recovery</h2>
            <p>
                Would your business survive a digital disaster? Unfortunately, without managed IT services, the answer to this question is usually ‘no’. If your business lost access to its most important data and files, the damage could be astronomical. This is why it is essential to have the right contingency planning, data backups, and disaster recovery systems in place.
                <br>

            <h2>Systems Management</h2>
            <p>
                Information technology systems can be extremely nuanced and complex, regardless of the context they are used in. Properly managing and protecting important files, records, financial data, and proprietary information is essential to the success of your business. But the correct organization of digital infrastructure can be a worthy challenge as your business develops and evolves.
                <br>
                Put simply, systems management is IT administration: our systems management services range in function and execution, and are custom developed to meet your business’s needs. Whether you need a highly specified contract project executed in real-time, or a long-range solution to the daily management of your IT, AEG Tech IT is prepared to handle it all.
                <br>
                Every management strategy starts with a good plan, and systems management is no different. From data development to sustainment and maintenance planning, AEG Tech IT takes pride in helping our clients prepare for the success of their company.
                <br>
                Our proactive approach to patching (modifying programs and systems to improved security) protects the time and resources you need to accelerate your business. At AEG Tech IT, we combine and modify all of these strategies— along with other essential elements— to create exceptional results. Call us today to learn what these results might look like for your business.

            <h2>Systems Monitoring</h2>
            <p>
                Systems monitoring is another formational aspect of IT systems management, and when correctly executed, plays an essential role in the efficiency and security of your digital assets and structure. However, adept systems monitoring is also extremely responsive: it ensures that any potential disruptions are immediately handled.
                <br>
                It involves— you guessed it— monitoring systems (typically through centralizing software) and collecting data on functions such as applications, server memory, bandwidth, CPU, routers, switches, and much more. Systems monitoring is the communication of devices and applications with the monitoring system (software) through protocols such as HTTP, WMI, OPC UA, SNMP, and MQTT. When actionable items crop up, our 24/7 help desk technicians are always ready to respond.
                <br>
                Systems monitoring not only helps businesses to understand where their resources are being used and how performance is impacted; it’s also essential to security functions. Systems monitoring helps to develop cohesion and efficiency within a technological framework on all levels of operations. Is your systems monitoring protocol effective? Or are important flags slipping between the cracks? Call AEG Tech today to ensure all of your bases are covered.
